## In Flight

- Test login/logout flow with actual Supabase instance.
- Test Gemini API key save/load functionality with real database.
- Expand navigation as new features are defined.
- Keep Memory Bank synchronized after each development session.

## Upcoming Ideas

- Integrate shadcn component registry for standardized UI pieces.
- Add localization strategy if bilingual support is required.
- Consider adding social login options (Google, GitHub) to registration flow.
- Use the newly configured Gemini API for AI-powered features (recipe suggestions, inventory insights).
