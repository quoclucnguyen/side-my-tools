# Side My Tools Mockup

Welcome to the Side My Tools documentation mockup. This single page acts as a placeholder for future content.

## What's Here

- A stripped-down Docusaurus instance tailored to serve just this page.
- Room to expand with real docs when the product spec solidifies.

## Next Up

When you're ready to add more documentation:

1. Create additional Markdown or MDX files in this folder.
2. Update `sidebars.ts` to list the new pages.
3. Refresh `docusaurus.config.ts` to reflect any new navigation needs.

Until then, enjoy the minimalist setup!
