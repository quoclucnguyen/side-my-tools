## AI Workflow & Memory Bank Expectations

- Always load the Cline Memory Bank before acting: review `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md` at the start of every task.
- Operate in Plan ➜ Act loops. Begin in Plan mode to confirm context, propose strategy, and request clarifications; only then switch to Act mode for implementation.
- Log meaningful changes: update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` after notable edits and append milestones to `memory-bank/progress.md`.
- When project knowledge evolves (new patterns, tech decisions, constraints), reflect it in the appropriate memory-bank file so future sessions stay aligned.
- Whenever database table definitions or schema updates are provided, capture them in the Memory Bank (e.g., update `techContext.md` or another relevant file) so future work stays consistent.
- If Memory Bank instructions conflict with ad-hoc requests, pause and surface the conflict rather than ignoring established process.
